This repository contains solutions for the following tasks:

## Task 1: Array Manipulation

Create a JavaScript file named `arrayManipulation.js` and add a function `processArray` that:
- Takes an array of numbers as an argument.
- Returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.

## Task 2: String Manipulation

Add a function `formatArrayStrings` to `arrayManipulation.js` that:
- Takes two arrays as arguments:
  - An array of strings.
  - An array of numbers processed by `processArray`.
- Modifies each string based on its corresponding number:
  - Capitalize the entire string if the number is even.
  - Convert the string to lowercase if the number is odd.

## Task 3: User Profiles

Create a file `userInfo.js` and add a function `createUserProfiles` that:
- Takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2.
- Returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and `id` (auto-incremented starting from 1).
